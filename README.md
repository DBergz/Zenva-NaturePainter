# Zenva-NaturePainter Course
This project was built following a class listed on Zenva.com

Upon opening the app the user can scan for horizontal planes and a grassy scene will populate the plane. 
The area of the plane is calculated and the grass is populated with flowers, mushrooms and bushes based 
on the area scanned.
